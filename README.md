# MNIST-Digit-Classification-using-an-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project demonstrates a multi-class classification task to predict handwritten digits using the well-known MNIST dataset. The prediction is accomplished by building and training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with the help of the TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
